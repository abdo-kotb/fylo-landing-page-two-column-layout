## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Font Awesome Library
- Google Fonts

### Continued development

I learned DOM a couple of weeks ago, so that was one of few times to implement my new knowledge of JavaScript and DOM into a challenge. I will update my solution to a better one if needed.
